# Overview

This is a Visual Studio Code remote dev container template for doing blockchain development with node.js and Hardhat

## Note about the first run

On the very first run the container needs to be built - This can take a while. The next run will be much faster.

# How to use

Instuctions for getting started with dev containers within Visual Studio Code can be [found here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
